<p align="center"> I have published a back-end project, in which there is a collection for companies and products, and I made CRUD operations for both. I used Typescript, Axios, React, React-Router, and Antd components. In the project, I used the Context structure both in useState and in Antd variables in a compatible way. The application also has JWT authentication. For the backend, I used Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose and the MongoDB as the database. </p>
